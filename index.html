      <p>I’m co-founder of <span class="modal-toggle figlink" data-image="https://cdn.glitch.com/44c83bf3-03ff-4d72-b496-0dff522b1583%2FLYRS_003_sm.jpeg?v=1578489193799">Bricklane</span>, a data-driven property investment platform. Built for investors looking to rationally access the residential property market with anywhere from £100 to £100m+; we are backed by Zoopla, Localglobe and the Daily Mail; and have been named as a ‘company to watch’ by the Financial Times.</p>

      <p>Before that I worked globally with a range of startups and more established institutions, as well as building my own products. These include <em><span class="modal-toggle figlink" data-image="https://cdn.glitch.com/44c83bf3-03ff-4d72-b496-0dff522b1583%2Fpeeps.jpg?v=1578490737864">Peeps</span></em> — a selfie video messaging iOS app that introduced a number of now commonplace UI patterns; <em><span class="modal-toggle figlink" data-image="https://cdn.glitch.com/44c83bf3-03ff-4d72-b496-0dff522b1583%2Fhelvetitee.png?v=1578492148909">Helvetitee</span></em> — one of the first single-serving ecommerce sites that received global press attention for its stark ‘no bullshit’ design; and <em><span class="modal-toggle figlink" data-image="https://cdn.glitch.com/44c83bf3-03ff-4d72-b496-0dff522b1583%2Fdsgnjbs.png?v=1578491083868">DSGNJBS</span></em> — a leading recruitment resource for the design community.</p>

      <p>I like getting email and chatting [in person], so say hi if you want to talk about design, the built environment, or <span class="modal-toggle figlink" data-image="https://snipboard.io/Hs3mQ7.jpg">borzois</span>.</p>
