            <p>I&#8217;m a designer, specifically a <em>digital product designer</em>, which in-short means I both design and develop software products&mdash;like web sites and mobile apps.</p>

            <p>I&#8217;m co-founder and Chief Design Officer at <a href="https://bricklane.com/" title="Bricklane">Bricklane</a>. We&#8217;re aiming to make it easier for people to get on the property ladder, using #innovation. We will be launching publicly in Q2 2016.</p>

            <p>Prior to that I worked at a number of startups in the UK and US, alongside building my own products and projects.</p>
            
            <p>I&#8217;m <a href="http://twitter.com/tomcavill" title="tomcavill twitter">tomcavill</a> on most of the <a href="http://instagram.com/tomcavill" title="tomcavill instagram">social</a> <a href="http://medium.com/@tomcavill" title="Medium">networks</a>, or <a href="http://github.com/cavill" title="Github">cavill</a> if I got in early enough.</p>

            <p>Whilst unavailable for work (no exceptions), I like getting <a href="mailto:tomcavill+dotcom@gmail.com" title="email tom cavill">email</a> and chatting IRL, so say hi if you want to talk about design, visual arts, concrete, bread or whippets. I&#8217;ve enjoyed the few speaking gigs I&#8217;ve done, and would be amenable to doing more.</p>
