      <p>I’m co-founder of Bricklane, a data-driven property investment platform. Built for investors looking to rationally access the residential property market with anywhere from £100 to £100m+, we are backed by Zoopla, Localglobe and the Daily Mail. We were named as one of ten ‘companies to watch’ by the Financial Times in 2017.</p>

      <p>Before that I worked at a number of startups in the UK, Europe, and US, as well as building my own products. These include <em>Peeps</em> — a selfie video messaging iOS app that introduced a number of now commonplace UI patterns; <em>Helvetitee</em> — one of the first single-serving ecommerce sites that received global press attention for its stark ‘no bullshit’ design; and <em>DSGNJBS</em> — a leading recruitment resource for the design community.</p>

      <p>My personal work has been featured in DesignMilk, Shortlist Magazine, Inqmind, DesignTaxi, SiteInspire, the Apple App Store, and elsewhere.</p>
      
      <p>I’m tomcavill on most of the social networks, or cavill if I got in early enough.</p>

      <p>I like getting email and chatting [in person], so say hi if you want to talk about design, the built environment, or borzois.</p>

      <p>Greatbye.</p>
