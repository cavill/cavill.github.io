            <p>Hi. I&#8217;m a designer, specifically a <em>digital product designer</em>, which in-short means I both design and develop software products&mdash;like web sites and mobile apps.</p>

            <p>I&#8217;m co-founder and Chief Design Officer at <a href="https://bricklane.com/" title="Bricklane">Bricklane</a>. We&#8217;re aiming to make it easier for people to get on the property ladder, using #innovation. We will be launching publicly in Q2 2016.</p>

            <p>Prior to that I worked at a number of startups in the UK and US, alongside building my own products and projects. For example, in 2014 <a href="http://alexedge.co.uk/">Alex Edge</a> and I made an iOS app called <a href="http://peeps.im" title="Peeps for iOS">Peeps</a>. We were featured in a couple of App Stores, and were Shortlist magazine&#8217;s app of the week. Our 3rd biggest territory was Iraq, which was weird.</p>

            <p>I also helped the <a href="http://www.britishcouncil.org" title="British Council">British Council</a> build an API for art events, and led a complete redesign of Danish retail company <a href="http://flyingtiger.com" title="Tiger Stores">Tiger</a>&#8217;s online presence, in time for their US launch. I help out <a href="http://generalsto.re" title="General Store, Peckham">General Store</a> with their stuff too, often in exchange for food.</p>

            <p>Startups I&#8217;ve worked with in the last &#126;3 years include <a href="http://mybuilder.com" title="MyBuilder">MyBuilder</a>, where I redesigned the site&#8217;s landing pages, and helped move the existing app into a responsive design; <a href="http://share.autographer.com" title="Autographer Share">Autographer</a>, where I designed &amp; built a photo-sharing web app to support their innovate wearable camera; <a href="http://meteor.com" title="Meteor">Meteor Development Group</a> (YC S11), for whom I made a lil&#8217; site with <a href="http://tableflip.io" title="Tabelflip">TableFlip</a> to celebrate an important milestone. I built an <a href="http://search.sleevenote.info" title="Sleevenote Search">artwork search tool</a> for Tom Vek&#8217;s <a href="http://sleevenote.info" title="Sleevenote">Sleevenote</a>; and helped design the first version of <a href="http://zesty.com" title="Zesty">Zesty.com</a>&#8217;s (YC W14), (then Hasty) awesome healthy food app.</p>

            <p>Before that I was Lead Designer for two years at <a href="http://top10.com" title="Top10">Top10.com</a>, when we created one of the first 12 apps on the <a href="http://spotify.com" title="Spotify">Spotify</a> platform, alongside a fun social recommendations web app.</p>

            <p>Other personal projects include the original design jobs aggregator, <a href="http://dsgnjbs.com" title="Design Jobs">dsgnjbs.com</a>; the popular simple t-shirt generator <a href="http://swisste.es" title="Swisstees">Swisstees</a> (formerly Helvetitee); and the book recommendation site <a href="http://knowall.io" title="Book recommendations">Knowall</a>.</p>

            <p>If you&#8217;re so inclined, I&#8217;m <a href="http://twitter.com/tomcavill" title="tomcavill twitter">tomcavill</a> on most of the <a href="http://instagram.com/tomcavill" title="tomcavill instagram">social</a> <a href="http://medium.com/@tomcavill" title="Medium">networks</a>, or cavill if I got in early enough.</p>

            <p>Whilst unavailable for work (no exceptions), I like getting <a href="mailto:tomcavill+dotcom@gmail.com" title="email tom cavill">email</a> and chatting IRL, so say hi if you want to talk about design or whatever it is you&#8217;re working on.</p>
