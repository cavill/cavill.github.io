      <p>I co-founded <span class="modal-toggle figlink" data-image="https://cdn.glitch.com/44c83bf3-03ff-4d72-b496-0dff522b1583%2FLYRS_003_sm.jpeg?v=1578489193799">Bricklane</span>, an investment platform backed by Zoopla, Localglobe and the Daily Mail; and named as a ‘company to watch’ by the Financial Times.</p>

      <p>Before that I worked globally with a range of startups and more established institutions.

      <p>My personal work has been featured in DesignMilk, Shortlist Magazine, Inqmind, DesignTaxi, SiteInspire, the Apple App Store, and elsewhere.</p>
